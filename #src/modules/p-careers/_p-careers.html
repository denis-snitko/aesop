            <h3>A global endeavour</h3>
            <p>We support an entrepreneurial spirit and cultivate a professional environment in which our employees are
                challenged to give their best; attention to detail and the pursuit of excellence are traits we
                encourage.</p>
            <p>We offer employees professional development and opportunities for advancement, within our regional and
                global offices, and retail stores around the world. All our workplaces interact regularly, exposing
                employees to different cultures and perspectives. This often manifests in enduring relationships and the
                occasional shared bottle of red wine.</p>
            <p>We value a diverse workplace. Women, people of colour, people with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ
                community are strongly encouraged to apply. We believe an equitable and inclusive work environment, and
                a diverse, empowered team are key to achieving our mission.</p>
